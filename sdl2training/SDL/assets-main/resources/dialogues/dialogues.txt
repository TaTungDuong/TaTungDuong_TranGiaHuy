Alright, do you hear me?
Seems you have arrived the target zone.
Before we get started, lets have a quick rehearsal again.
First, try move around the area using W, A, S, D.
Don't walk into the toxic red mist though.
//end part//
Good, now shoot your gun with left mouse button.
You can switch weapon using Q or mouse wheel also.
And remember you can't shoot through the bushes.
//end part//
Great, now activate your skill by pressing R.
Skill will be different based on the current weapon you're holding.
And the cooldown will be 10 seconds, so pay attention!
//end part//
Alright enough for now... Wait whats that?
Seems the cyborgs are heading to your position now!
Watch out and don't let them get close to you!
//end part//
Well we don't have much time left now.
I found the locations of all the signals.
Your mission is to destroy all of them.
I will mark the coordinates for you.
The cyborgs will stop spawning once you finish the job.
//end part//
Great! Seems you have destroyed all the signals.
We are coming to rescue you.
Hold on and don't die!
//end part//
