Alright, do you hear me?
Seems you have arrived the target zone.
Before we get started, lets have a quick rehearsal again.
First, try move around the area using W, A, S, D.
Don't walk into the toxic red mist though.
//end part//
Good, now shoot your gun with left mouse button.
You can switch weapon using Q or mouse wheel also.
And remember you can't shoot through the bushes.
//end part//
Great, now activate your skill by pressing R.
Skill will be different based on the current weapon you're holding.
And the cooldown will be 10 seconds, so pay attention!
//end part//
Oh, and as you can see, there are milk around.
The research data showed that milk can heal your health.
So, I stole them from the storehouse.
I will drop it randomly on the ground.
Feel free to enjoy to your heart content!
Alright enough for now... Wait whats that?
Seems the cyborgs are heading to your position now!
Watch out and don't let them get close to you!
//end part//
Well we don't have much time left now.
I found the locations of all the signals.
Your mission is to destroy all of them.
I will mark the coordinates for you.
The cyborgs will stop spawning once you finish the job.
//end part//
Great! Seems you have destroyed all the signals.
Now we can access the security system.
I will open the door to the next floor for you.
It might take some times, tho.
Have fun for a while!
//end part//
